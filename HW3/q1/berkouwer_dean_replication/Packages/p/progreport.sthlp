{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:progreport} merges the master dataset and survey dataset to track the progress
of data collection and reports completion rates by the sortby variable.

{pstd}
Progress Report.xlsx is created and includes a summary sheet of completion rate 
by the sortby variable, as well as a sheet for each value of the sortby variable. 
This includes a status for each observation in the master dataset and a submission
date for those that have been interviewed. If specified, {cmd:progreport} can also 
create a dataset only including those who have not been interviewed. 


{marker remarks}{...}
{title:Remarks}

{pstd}
{cmd:progreport} reduces time spent tracking survey progress by clearly 
reporting progress across all data collection and broken down by a sorting variable.  

{marker remarks}{...}
{title:Remarks for options tracking() and tvar()}

{pstd}
{cmd:tracking()} and {cmd:tvar()} are used when the data collection also includes 
a tracking form that enumerators use when they cannot interview a respondent.{cmd:tracking()} 
is the location of the tracking dataset, and {cmd:tvar()} is the 
categorical variable in the tracking dataset that specifies the reason why the respondent
could not be interviewed at that time. This tracking dataset should also have an 
observation for each attempt to interview a respondent. 

{pstd}
When {cmd:tracking()} and {cmd:tvar()} are included, each sheet's output will 
also include columns "track_date" and "pr_attempts". For each observation, "track_date"
will show the most recent tracking form submission date (if any)and "pr_attempts" 
will show the number of attempts, calculated by collapsing the tracking dataset
by observation.

{pstd}
The "status" output column will still appear green and will say "Submitted" if the
respondent has a survey submitted in the survey dataset, even if they had a previous
tracking form entry. The "status" column will appear yellow and read "Only Tracking Form"
 if the respondent does not appear in the survey dataset but has at least one 
 tracking dataset observation, and will appear red and read "Not Submitted" if the 
 respondent only appears in the master dataset.
